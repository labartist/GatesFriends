    <h3>Listing locations online improves accessibility of vaccines</h3>
<p>SEATTLE, Washington-- We are students at the University of Washington, Seattle, and we
  fervently believe that The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation is doing an incredible job
  of helping the world.<br /><br />
   However, we feel that they are lacking one thing: Their locations from which they distribute
   vaccines are not displayed online. Only the location of their offices is available online.
   While they may be partnering with local governments and NGOs, I believe that their
   outreach would be much better if they displayed the locations of their primary health
   centers online. I am not just speculating, but am speaking from experience.
<br /><br /></p><p>
 I am from India, which is still a developing country. My mother runs a free dispensary in
 New Delhi, India, for the poor. A lot of the times my mother sends her patients to local
 labs and hospitals where they charge a lot less than the market rate for certain tests
 in an attempt to give back to society.
 <br /><br />

While my mother is aware of the local places where tests are done either free or at a rate
which is less than the market rate, the general public is not aware of these places. Not every poor
person in the neighborhood is aware of the cheaper alternatives.<b> Building off of this example, what
I'm trying to say is that if the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has reduced deaths by 5 million
per year by teaming up with local governments, imagine the outreach if they listed the locations of
their primary health centers online.</b>
<br /><br /> It is also not just about simply posting the location, we have come up with some ideas
on how to make the website as useful as possible for the general public:
   <ul><li><p>The locate us tab provides details of the locations of the primary health centers set up
     to distribute vaccines and other items. Once you click on the marker for one of the locations, you can
     either get the directions, or see the availability of vaccines in each location.
    </p>
      <li><p>Once you open the database for a location, it displays the Vaccine name, availability of <thead>
        vaccine, dosage, and details about the disease for which the vaccine is being administered.
      </thead>
      </p>
      <li><p>There is also a 'Request Vaccine' tab that allows people to request a vaccine that is
        not listed on the website</p>
      <li><p>The 'Doctor's Appointment' tab allows you to view the various doctors available in
        various locations, along with hours of operation, and a link to book appointment</p></li>
<li><p>
        The 'Other Services' tab allows people to view the other services being offered by The Bill
        and Melinda Gates Foundation </p></li>

        <p>My hope from this website is that it helps to increase the outreach of the foundation, so that
          even more people can benefit from their philanthropic work. I will not limit my work to this
          hackathon; I will pursue and take this up with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. I feel
          lucky that I am in the same city as the headquarters of the foundation and the city where Bill and
          Melinda Gates themselves live.
